# Sudoku

This is our final project in a course named "Software Project" that focuses on developing in C languae. 

The project is an interactive command-line Sudoku game with an ILP (Integer Programming) solver component that uses mathematical optimization methods to speed up the solution time. 

The project has the following functionalities:
 - Solving Sudoku puzzles
 - Editing existing and creating new Sudoku puzzles
 - Supporting puzzles of any size
 - Validating the board 
 - Saving and loading puzzles from files 
 - Randomly generating new puzzles
 - Finding the number of solutions for a given board
 - Auto-filling option for obvious cells (where only a single value is valid)
 
 Have fun!
